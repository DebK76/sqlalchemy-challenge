# sqlalchemy-challenge
This was by far one of the most challenging assignments to complete
I did my very best to pull from the resources that I had (TA's, Lectures, Activities, and online forums)
I got started by reviewing the CSV data and all files provided to compelete the assigment (climate_starter.ipynb, and hawaii,sqlite)
Starting with importing the various dependencies for the file "Climate_starte" in Juypter notebook and the same action for app.py file
You can consider this challenge as a vacation or holiday to Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with planning this trip, I was tasked to conduct a climate analysis about the area
Through the analysis and exploration of the climate data, I will use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Panadas, and Matplotlib to also conduct precipitation analysis
